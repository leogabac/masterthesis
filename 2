\section{Geometrical Frustration}
In physical systems, frustration arises when local interactions cannot be satisfied simultaneously for all of its components, typically due to geometrical constraints that make it impossible for all interactions energies to be minimized. Geometrical Frustration is observed in many condensed matter systems such as water ice \cite{bernalTheoryWaterIonic1933}, spin ice \cite{harrisGeometricalFrustrationFerromagnetic1997,nisoliTopologyDesignMagnetic2018,ortiz-ambrizColloquiumIceRule2019,skjaervoAdvancesArtificialSpin2020}, assemblies \cite{grasonPerspectiveGeometricallyFrustrated2016}, metallic glasses \cite{sethnaFrustrationCurvatureDefect1985,ganeshInitioSimulationsGeometrical2008,hirataGeometricFrustrationIcosahedron2013}, liquid crystals \cite{selingerDirectorDeformationsGeometric2022}, and the conspicuous spin glass \cite{mydoshSpinGlassesExperimental1993,zimmerInterplaySpinglassClusters2014,yokotaEffectsGeometricalFrustration2014,altieriIntroductionTheorySpin2024}. In consequence, frustrated systems often exhibit non-trivial dynamics, configurations and peculiar properties such as residual entropy \cite{paulingStructureEntropyIce1935,giauqueMolecularRotationIce1933,ramirezZeropointEntropySpin1999}, a degenerate ground state \cite{moessnerGeometricalFrustration2006}, glassiness \cite{ferreroFreezingLargeTime2003,chakrabartyClusterSpinGlass2014,mahmoudianGlassyDynamicsGeometrically2015, weigtGlassyBehaviorInduced2003}, or ergodicity breaking \cite{malinsGeometricFrustrationSmall2009,janisErgodicityBreakingFrustrated2015,sacconeRealspaceObservationErgodicity2023}. The quintessential example of a geometrically frustrated system is the Ising Model of $N$ interacting spings in a triangular lattice. Consider the free-field Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  H = -\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}J_{ij}\sigma_i \sigma_j,
  \label{eq:isingmodel}
\end{equation}
where $\langle i,j \rangle$ denotes a sum over nearest-neighbor (NN) pairs, and $\sigma_i = \pm 1$ represents a binary Ising variable. When $J_{ij} < 0$, the ground state (GS) corresponds to an arrangement where all spins are antiparallel to their nearest neighbors \cite{wannierAntiferromagnetismTriangularIsing1950}, resulting in an antiferromagnetic (AF) configuration.

  \caption[Antiferromagnetic Ising model]{Ising Model in (a) Square Lattice and (b) Triangular Lattice. (c) The ground state of the triangular minimizes the number of frustated bonds per site.}\label{fig:frustration}
\end{figure}


In 1D spin chains and 2D square lattices, this condition is trivially satisfied (see Figure \ref{fig:frustration}a. However, on a 2D triangular lattice, topological constraints prevent the existence of a configuration where every spin is antiferromagnetically bonded to all its neighbors, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:frustration}b. As a result, the ground state consists of a combination of AF bonds and frustrated bonds. Specifically, the GS is determined by minimizing the number of frustrated bonds at each spin site, see Figure \ref{fig:frustration}c. Frustrated systems have been extensively researched both theoretically, and experimentally  to understand how frustration affects the physical properties of a system. 

\section{Natural and Artificial Frustrated Systems}
In this section, we introduce two naturally occurring frustrated systems: water ice and spin ice, both governed by the so-called ice rules. We then explore some artificial realizations of spin ice systems, which provides the basis for the realizations of Colloidal Ice.

\subsection{Water Ice and the Ice-Rule}

Water has many distictive features, some of them indispensable for sustaining life on Earth. One peculiar property is the presence of residual entropy at temperatures close to the absolute zero. This characteristic was first evidenced by Giaque and Ashley in 1933 \cite{giauqueMolecularRotationIce1933} when they performed a series of calorimetric experiments to determine the entropy of water, and found that it does not vanish. The crystal structure of the Oxygen atoms in water ice was already known from X-ray studies \cite{dennisonCrystalStructureIce1921} to form a tetrahedron with one Hydrogen atom between O-O pairs bounded by either a covalent or hydrogen bond.

In 1933, Bernal and Fowler introduced the so-called ice rules \cite{bernalTheoryWaterIonic1933}, aiming to describe this particular arrangement. These rules state that each oxygen atom in the lattice is tetrahedrally coordinated, forming bonds with four neighboring hydrogen atoms. Of these four bonds, two must be covalent (with hydrogen atoms tightly bound to the oxygen), and the other two must be hydrogen bonds (loosely associated with adjacent oxygen atoms). This arrangement ensures local charge neutrality and satisfies the structural constraints imposed by the geometry and hydrogen bonding interactions.

\vspace{1em} INCLUDE FIGURE OF THE REGULAR ICE RULE\vspace{1em}

Later in 1935, Pauling \cite{paulingStructureEntropyIce1935} theoretically and experimentally confirmed the residual entropy of water. He considered a lattice with $N$ vertices (oxygen atoms) and $2N$ edges (possible hydrogen and covalent bonds), yielding $2^{2N}$ possible bond configurations. Focusing on a single oxygen atom and its four neighbors, there are $2^4 = 16$ possible arrangements. However, due to geometrical and distance constraints, only six configurations are allowed, resulting in a fraction of $6/16$ of the total possible configurations.

Thus, the number of configurations in the ground state is given by
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \qty(\dfrac{3}{8})^N 2^{2N} = \qty(\frac{3}{2})^N, 
\label{eq:configurations}
\end{equation}

Using the Boltzmann entropy relation, the residual entropy per site is calculated as
\begin{equation} 
\dfrac{S}{N} = k_\mathrm{B}\ln(\dfrac{3}{2}).
\label{eq:ice_entropy}
\end{equation}

With these arguments, Pauling showed that the number of configurations for the GS grows exponentially with the number of Oxygen atoms, resulting in an extensive degeneracy that produces in turn the obseved residual entropy.

\subsection{Spin Ice}

Some magnetic materials exhibit properties analogous to those of water ice at low temperatures. In fact, taking one of Pauling's assumptions, a binary (spin) degree of freedom can be assigned to each oxygen atom, corresponding to its orientation pointing into or out of a vertex (see Fig.\ref{fig:water_spin}) depending on the relative positions of protons \cite{nisoliTopologyDesignMagnetic2018}. This ice-like spin structure is observed in ferromagnetic pyrochlore oxides of the form $\mathrm{R}_2\mathrm{Ti}_2\mathrm{O}_7$, where $\mathrm{R}$ represents a rare earth element. These rare earth atoms are positioned at the corners of tetrahedra, which collectively form the structure known as the Pyrochlore lattice.

  \caption[The ice rule for water ice]{The ice rule for water ice. Water molecules (left) arrange themselves in such a way that hydrogen atoms bond with the two neares oxygen atoms. By replacing atoms with spins pointing in/out of each tetrahedron (right), then the ice-rule can be mapped to the arrangement of magnetic pyrochlores. Image by Nisoli \protect{\cite{nisoliTopologyDesignMagnetic2018}}}\label{fig:water_spin}
\end{figure}

The connection between the Ising Model in this lattice and water ice was first pointed out theoretically by Phillip Anderson in 1956 \cite{andersonOrderingAntiferromagnetismFerrites1956}, decades before the pyrochlore, holmium titanate ($\mathrm{Ho}_2\mathrm{Ti}_2\mathrm{O}_7$) was identified as spin ice in 1997. These compounts, also know as \emph{spin ice}, are modelled by the Dipolar Spin Ice Hamiltonian \cite{levisTwodimensionalSpinIce2012,rodriguezgalloColloidalDynamicsArtificial2024}:

\begin{equation}
  H = -\dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\displaystyle\sum_{i,j}\dfrac{1}{r_{ij}^3}\qty[3(\vb{m}_i\cdot \vu{r}_{ij})(\vb{m}_j\cdot \vu{r}_{ij})-\vb{m}_i\cdot \vb{m}_j] -\dfrac{1}{(g\mu_B)^2}\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}J_{ij}\vb{m}_i \cdot \vb{m}_j,
  \label{eq:spinice_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0$ is the vaccum permeability, $\vb{m}_i$ the magnetic moments, $\vu{r}_{ij}$ the separation vector, $\mu_B$ the Bohr magneton, $g$ a dimensionless constant,and $J_{ij}$ the exchange interaction term. The first term of the Hamiltonian represents pair-wise magnetic dipole-dipole interactions where the moments are defined in terms of the Bohr magneton $\vb{m}=g\mu_B \vb*{\sigma}_i$. The second term corresponds to an Ising model with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions.

Although spin ice differs fundamentally from water ice, it is governed by similar topological constraints, leading to an analogous formulation of the ice rules. In magnetic pyrochlores, these rules dictate that each tetrahedron must have two spins pointing inward and two pointing outward.

In the 1990s, inspired by rare-earth pyrochlores and aiming to generalize Pauling's ice model, researchers renewed interest in ice-like systems. This resurgence quickly led to the development of \emph{vertex models}, which are Ising-like systems where spin degrees of freedom are located on the edges of a lattice, and interactions are defined at the vertices. These models introduced generalized versions of the ice rules, which will be discussed in the following section.

\subsection{Artificial Spin Ice}

Working with magnetic materials in bulk presents significant challenges, including issues with control and visualization. To overcome these limitations, scientists have developed simplified two-dimensional projections of pyrochlores that adhere to the same ice rules. These model systems are known as Artificial Spin Ice (ASI). 
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/ch2/ice_projection.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption[Two-dimensional projection of the Pyrochlore Lattice]{Two-dimensional projection of the Pyrochlore Lattice.

Edited image from Glaetzle et. al. \cite{glaetzleQuantumSpinIceDimer2014}}\label{fig:2dpyrochlore}
\end{figure}

Artificial Spin Ice refers to systems composed of two-dimensional arrays of interacting magnetic nanostructures. Introduced in 2006 by Wang et al. \cite{wangArtificialSpinIce2006a}, ASI serves as a two-dimensional analogue to natural spin ices. The system consisted of a square lattice of lithographically fabricated single-domain ferromagnetic islands sitting on the edges of the lattice. In fact, this arrangement can be directly seen as a $2d$ projection of the Pyrochlore lattice (Fig. \ref{fig:2dpyrochlore}). 

The authors classified the vertices into types I–IV based on increasing magnetostatic energy and analyzed the fraction of each vertex type after a annealing protocol. Their results demonstrated ice-like behavior, where the system favored vertices with two spins pointing in and two spins pointing out. This work showcased the potential of nanostructures as platforms for directly visualizing, exploring, and engineering lattices with controlled dynamics.

\end{figure}

As ASI broadened the landscape of what ice-like systems could be, the ice-rule then needed a topological definition that could be applied into any lattice \cite{ortiz-ambrizColloquiumIceRule2019}. Consider any lattice with cooridnation number $z$ and spins on the edges, then we can define a topological charge on the vertex with $n$ spins pointing into it as:
\begin{equation}
  q = 2n-z.
\label{eq:topological_charge}
\end{equation}

This notion is purely topological and corresponds to the difference of spins pointing in and out of each vertex. The ice-rule in this context, takes the form of a local minimization of $\abs{q}$. Depending on the topology and interactions, the ice-rule can take many forms. Any subset of the phase space that adheres to the ice-rule configurations is regarded as an \emph{ice manifold}.Remarkably, for isotropic spins in a lattice with even coordination number, the ice manifold corresponds to $q=0$, characterized by a 2in/2out configuration. Single spin flips from this state induce a local charge inbalance that violates the ice rule. This proces creates a pair of $q=\pm2$ monopoles or defects.

In contrast, the ice-rule in lattices with odd coordination number, such as the Kagomé lattice \cite{qiDirectObservationIce2008,mengottiRealspaceObservationEmergent2011,skjaervoAdvancesArtificialSpin2020}, cannot accomodate $q=0$ vertices. Instead, the ice manifold is dominated by $q=\pm1$ vertices, which govern the system's behavior.

\end{figure}

One of the advantages of ASI is its tunability. Researchers can design and engineer the geometry and interactions between nanostructures, enabling them to create tailored magnetic textures with specific properties, to directly visualize phenomenology from ice-type and  vertex models that are not necessarily found in nature. This control has led to the observation of a wide range of magnetic behaviors such as magnetic monopole-like excitations \cite{mengottiRealspaceObservationEmergent2011}, and chiral dynamics \cite{gligaEmergentDynamicChirality2017}. In the following section, we will introduce a particle-based ice-like model that was developed as an alternative to ASI.




\section{Artificial Colloidal Ice}

Colloidal Models provide a versatile platform to study emergent phenomena across many complex systems in Statistical Physics due to the tunability of their interactions and accesible length scales. Colloids have been used to \textbf{[CITE]}...

\subsection{Charged Colloids}
Inspired by the work of Wang et al. and the versatility of colloids, A. Libál, C. Reichhardt, and C. J. Olson Reichhardt \cite{libalRealizingColloidalArtificial2006} proposed a particle-based alternative for Artificial Ice. They considered a square lattice composed of elongated optical traps, each containing a single charged colloid (see Figure \ref{fig:libal}a). The traps were modeled using a bistable potential, allowing the particle to occupy one of two stable positions. 


\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/ch2/libal.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption[Particle-based electric ice model]{Particle-based electric ice model. (a) Charged colloidal particles are placed one-to-one in elongated bistable optical traps. (b) Ground State (2in/2out) configuration (c) Fraction of vertices of each type with increasing electric interactions (d) Fractions of vertices with increasing trap separation. }\label{fig:libal}
\end{figure}

The spin degree of freedom, characterized by in/out behavior, was directly mapped from the particle's position. Specifically, a vertex is assigned a \emph{spin} pointing toward it if the particle is in the position nearest to that vertex. They classified the vertices into six types based on the single-vertex electrostatic energy, ranked from lowest to highest. Type I corresponds to a vertex where all particles are far from the vertex, while type VI has all particles close to the vertex. By mapping the particle configuration to spin degrees of freedom, the vertex types correspond to topological charges ranging from $q = -4$ to $q = 4$, respectively. 

Figure \ref{fig:libal}c shows the fraction of vertices of each type with increasing charge $q$. They observed that as interactions strengthen, the system quickly becomes dominated by Type III vertices until it reaches equilibrium. This equilibrium configuration corresponds to an ice-rule, 2-in/2-out state (Figure \ref{fig:libal}b), which minimizes the topological charge locally due to frustration. Notably, although Type IV vertices also obey the ice rules, they possess higher energy in this particle-based ice and therefore do not form part of the ground-state configuration. Additionally, increasing the trap separation $d$ (see Figure \ref{fig:libal}d) and consequently reducing the interactions results in a similar effect: a transition from a 2-in/2-out configuration to a disordered system. In fact, this process can be visualized as the reverse of the transition shown in Figure \ref{fig:libal}c. 

\subsection{Paramagnetic Colloids}

The theoretical work from Libál and collaborators demonstrate that a colloidal system can effectively model artificial ice. One key advantage of the colloidal approach is the ability to directly observe the dynamic behavior of individual \emph{spins}. Furthermore, it enables the creation of more intricate systems than those achievable with their magnetic counterpart. However, the significant laser power needed to generate the required optical traps, along with the challenges in adjusting surface charge in colloidal systems, highlights the need for an alternative approach. Inspired by their work and acknowledging the challenges, Ortiz-Ambriz, A. and Tierno, P. \cite{ortiz-ambrizEngineeringFrustrationColloidal2016} proposed an alternative version of particle ice that uses microscopic magnetic particles, confined by gravity in litographically-sculpted bistable traps, and is now known as Artificial Colloidal Ice.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/ch2/engineering_frustration.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption[Experimental realization of Artificial Colloidal Ice]{Experimental realization of Artificial Colloidal Ice. (a) Schematic of Artificial Colloidal Ice in a honeycomb lattice.

Modified image from Ortiz-Ambriz, A. and Tierno, P. \cite{ortiz-ambrizEngineeringFrustrationColloidal2016}.}\label{fig:engineering_frustration}
\end{figure}

In their setup, paramagnetic colloidal particles are placed with optical tweezers inside double-well traps that are sculpted by etching a photocurable resin and leaving a small central hill as shown in Figure \ref{fig:engineering_frustration}a. The traps were arranged in both square, and honeycomb lattices with lattice constant of $a=44\mu$m and $a=33\mu$m. The profile of the taps is show in Figures \ref{fig:engineering_frustration}b and \ref{fig:engineering_frustration}c from which they determined an average barrier height of $h\approx 0.43 \pm 0.04\mu$m that confines the particles in either of the two stable positions within the traps with an estimated potential barrier of $U_g\approx 540k_bT$.

The particles are doped with iron oxide grains, making them responsive to an external magnetic field $\vb{B}$. The applied field induces a magnetic dipole moment
\begin{equation}
  \vb{m} =\frac{V\chi}{\mu_0}\vb{B},
  \label{eq:dipole_moment}
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the volume of the colloids, $\chi$ the magnetic susceptibility, and $\mu_0$ the magnetic permeability in vacuum. Using this setup, colloids interact via magnetic dipole-dipole forces:
\begin{equation}
  U_{dd} = -\dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\displaystyle\sum_{i,j}\dfrac{1}{r_{ij}^3}\qty[3(\vb{m}_i\cdot \vu{r}_{ij})(\vb{m}_j\cdot \vu{r}_{ij})-\vb{m}_i\cdot \vb{m}_j],
  \label{eq:dipole_potential}
\end{equation}
which reduces to a repulsive, isotropic force field assuming that all dipole moments are equal $\vb{m}_i = \vb{m}_j = \vb{m}$, and $\vb{m} \cdot \vu{r}_{ij} =0$ as the field is orthogonal to the particle's plane.
\begin{equation}
  U_{dd} = \frac{\mu_0m^2}{4\pi r_{ij}^3}.
  \label{eq:dipole_potential_isotropic}
\end{equation}
Similar to the work of Libál et al. \cite{libalRealizingColloidalArtificial2006}, they classified the vertices by energy, labeling them I–VI for the square lattice and I–IV for the honeycomb lattice, as shown in Figures \ref{fig:engineering_frustration}f and \ref{fig:engineering_frustration}g. Due to the similarities between electrostatic and magnetostatic forces, the labels for the square lattice remain unchanged.

In the square lattice, they observed that as the magnetic field increases, the fraction of Type III ($S_{III}$) vertices rises to approximately 0.8 (Figure \ref{fig:engineering_frustration}e), which closely approaches the true square ice ground state. Similarly, in the honeycomb lattice, $K_{II}$ vertices dominate (Figure \ref{fig:engineering_frustration}d), as they maximize the average particle distance. Notably, these results successfully reproduce the ice manifolds characteristic of each topology. In the honeycomb lattice, monopoles with a net charge of $q = \pm1$ are energetically preferred over other configurations, whereas zero-charge configurations are favored in the square lattice.

\subsection{Phenomenology in Artificial Colloidal Ice}

  \caption[Ice Rules as emergent behavior in Artificial Colloidal Ice]{Ice Rules as emergent behavior in Artificial Colloidal Ice. At the single-vertex level, particles repel each other to form a $q=4$ configuration. At the collective level, frustration leads the system into an ice-rule state.}\label{fig:acigs}
\end{figure}

Artificial Colloidal Ice (ACI) has been found to obey the ice rule and can be considered an equivalent system to traditional ice. Despite sharing a similar history, motivation, and dynamics, particle-based ice differs fundamentally from magnetic Artificial Spin Ice (ASI) in terms of its energetic properties and the manifestation of frustration effects. In ASI, the ground-state (GS) configuration at the single-vertex level promotes adherence to the ice rule. Conversely, in ACI, vertices that violate the ice rule are energetically favorable at the single-vertex level. Specifically, the GS configuration corresponds to $q=-4$ vertices as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:acigs} (left). However, in the thermodynamic limit, the single-vertex GS cannot be locally satisfied for every vertex. This leads to frustration, and the ice manifold emerges as a result of this frustration. In ACI, it is said that the ice rule is locally unstable and fragile.


A framework connecting particle-based ice (PI) with magnet-based ice was developed in 2018 by Nisoli, C. \cite{nisoliUnexpectedPhenomenologyParticleBased2018}. In this framework, PI at equilibrium is mapped to spin ice (SI) coupled to a geometry-dependent background field. For regular geometries, PI is entirely equivalent to SI, a result that has been experimentally verified. Most notably, Nisoli highlighted that in non-trivial geometries, the ice rule can break down, leading to novel phenomena—some of which have been observed experimentally and will be discussed in the following paragraphs, while others remain unexplored.

In bidisperse colloidal ice systems, where particles vary magnetic susceptibility and traps vary in length, the system exhibits re-entrant behavior at high magnetic fields, ultimately resulting in disorder \cite{rodriguez-galloDegeneracyHysteresisBidisperse2021}. Additionally, by varying the magnetic field rate, the authors observed that sufficiently fast rates caused the fraction of Type III vertices to retrace itself, showing a small hysteresis effect. In a separate study, the role and effects of boundary constraints on the bulk behavior of artificial colloidal ice were investigated \cite{rodriguez-galloTopologicalBoundaryConstraints2021a}.

  \end{center}
  \caption[Bidisperse Artificial Colloidal Ice]{}\label{fig:phenom1}
\end{figure}

Nontrivial geometries, such as the Cairo lattice where vertices of mixed coordination number $z$ coexist, provide a setting where the ice rule is locally violated. Monopoles with the lowest possible charge emerge at their respective vertices \cite{rodriguez-galloIceRuleBreakdown2023}. Due to frustration, the monodisperse system accumulates monopoles of charge $q=2$ at $z=4$ vertices and $q=-1$ at $z=3$ vertices. This process results in a clear separation of net charge by coordination number and the transfer of charge between sublattices at low interaction strengths. A similar phenomenon has been observed in the lattice transformation of Shakti-Cairo colloidal ice \cite{rodriguez-galloGeometricalControlTopological2023}.
