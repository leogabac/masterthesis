*TL;DR:* Methods section is finished, working on reults.

# Thesis
Already finished the _methods_ section, and I am working on the _Results_. The section is structured on 

1. Reviewing the interactions and understand them to justify the MC simulations on why the GS is the GS.
2. Small linearly quenched system
3. Rotating system

## On the montecarlo
I am currently writing the results for the MonteCarlo methods to say how we found the GS. We only did simulations for MC with the smaller system in a $$10\times 10$$ lattice. I was thinking on whether I should make another one, just bigger, for the sake of completitude. I am not using my minipc right now anyways.

What do you think?

> Any feedback?

# Is Glass working?

What is says. Is Glass finally working? How is it going?

# TA Work

I saw that the students from Thermodynamics of Materials already submitted their HW. I haven't checked it yet but the plan is to check them on Thursdays and Friday.

# Life?

Got accepeted :D
