*TL;DR:* Worked in the methods section of my thesis.

# Thesis
This week I have been working in the _Methods_ section in particular. I made a few diagrams, and continued writing. I haven't been as fast as I wanted to be, perhaps the change of pace from the previous literature-binging section threw me off for a moment, but I am making progress. I am still missing some diagrams and text, but should be finished before next week.

> Any feedback?

# TA Work

Is there anything I should know?
- Courses
- Start/End dates
- What to expect?

# Glass
Is Glass working? How is that going?
