# Square Anisotropic Artificial Colloidal Ice

This repo contains specific code that I used to make my master thesis and is not necessarily related to other repos.
It contains (most probably) visualizations and schematics. Actual LaTeX document is stored locally and explicitely in the `.gitignore`.

The related repositories for this work are the following:

- [Exploratory simulations on AACI](https://github.com/leogabac/rotBField). Currently archived.
- [Spin Freezing in AACI](https://github.com/leogabac/stuckgs).
